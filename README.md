# modbot.js
This is my very first coding project. A Discord moderator bot that uses slash commands
 
 I build this bot while following the Discord Developer Docs:
 https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro
 And the Discordjs Guide:
 https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin
 
 To deploy the bot & commands:
 Run node deploy-commands.js in your terminal.
 Run node bot.js to deploy the bot.
